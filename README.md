# Overview
In this analysis, we use Tableau to visualize NYC Citi bikesharing data from August 2019 in order to propose the implementation of a similar bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA.

## Results

![Checkout Times for Users](/images/1.jpg)
Most trips are under twenty minutes, with the most popular during under ten minutes.
![Checkout Times by Gender](/images/2.jpg)
We can see that most users identify as male, though male and female users follow the same trend of trip duration. All genders' trips peak under the ten minutes.
![Trips by Weekday per Hour](/images/3.jpg)
In this heatmap, we observe weekday rush hour periods in the morning and early evening, with Wednesday evenings not as heavy in trip traffic, and Thursday mornings and evenings with especially heavy trip traffic. In contrast, the weekend days show more trips compared to weekday days with the exception of Friday.

All genders follow the same pattern of usage based on time and day.

In this heatmap, we notice that there are far more subscribers than casual customers. With a subscribership, it will be easier to predict level of usage depending on the day of the week. For customers, all genders follow a similar pattern of usage. For subscribers, we see that there is no unknown category, meaning all subscribers had to choose male or female to create their accounts. The difference between female and male-identifying users' trips show that although Thursday is the most popular day, Friday and Saturday trips for female-identifying users are not as prolific.
![Peak Riding Hours](/images/6.jpg)
This bar chart details the peak hours of the entire month of August. We see that on average, the morning peak is within eight to nine o'clock while the evening peak is five to six o'clock. This also shows that the minimum usage is during the three to four o'clock hour which can suggest this is a good time for bike repairs.

This treemap highlights the amount of bikes that would require the most maintenance. Each point represents with color and size the total number of rides the bike has undergone. 



## Summary
This analysis explores several areas of interest that will help with the design of a new bikesharing program. Although the location may not be the same, these observations of trip duration, trips based on time, trips based on user type, and overall bike utilization will aid in assessing the demand of this type of program on the city and its streets.

Two additional visualizations:
- Pie chart showing detailed proportions of customers and subscribers in total and by average number of trips per day or week with a breakdown of demographics such as gender and age
- Line chart displaying trip duration by age
